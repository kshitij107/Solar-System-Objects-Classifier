# Solar-System-Objects-Classifier
*** IMPORTANT INFORMATION ***

--- Please read before running the code ---

1. The dataset, all_trained.csv was created by taking the attributes from Solontoi and
2MASS in order to change our IDFlags (For a subset of the SDSS Data) as follows -

	a. IDFlag = 1 => Asteroid (Unchanged)
	b. IDFlag = 2 => Comets (New)
	c. IDFlag = 3 => Natural Satellites (New)

2. The dataset, sdss_differences.csv was created from the SDSS Catalogue by taking the
differences between the U-G, G-R, R-I, I-Z attributes for the objects IDFlag = 0.
